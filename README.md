9:11
Jan 2024
Made with GameMaker

9:11 was developed for the Global Game Jam held at our college in early 2024. The game, built around the theme "make me laugh," is a 2D runner where players dodge obstacles to reach the goal. It features a humorous story based on faculty members from our college, presented as an inside joke.

The game's character design, environment, and obstacles were all crafted manually in Ibis, giving it a distinctive hand-drawn aesthetic. The project includes custom cutscenes and an engaging user interface to enhance the narrative experience. 9:11 received a lot of positive feedback from mentors and was a standout entry in the Global Game Jam.
