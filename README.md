# 9:11
9:11 is a hilarious 2D runner game that captures the frantic adventure of a professor racing against the clock. The goal? To reach the classroom before the punch-in window closes at 9:10 AM! Armed with a laser beam shooting from his head *because it’s just that smooth* our professor must destroy pesky sheets of paper (students' doubts) and dodge mirrors (he’s a big fan of his own reflection).

Created in just 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2024, with the theme "Make Me Laugh", this game was a blast to make and play.

The Team:

>Aaradhya Bhatiya – Programmer/Developer<br>
>Swarnima Bisht – Programmer/Developer/Source Control<br>
>Navya Nandini – Artist/Animator/Game Designer<br>
>Harshika Bilwal – Artist/Animator/Assistant Programmer<br>

We explored Game Maker, ibis, and other tools during the jam, learning a lot and having a blast. Enjoy the chaos and see if you can help our professor make it on time!
